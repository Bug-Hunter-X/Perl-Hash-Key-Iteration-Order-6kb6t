This repository contains a simple Perl script that demonstrates an uncommon bug related to hash key iteration order. The script iterates through a hash and prints the key-value pairs. However, the order of iteration is not guaranteed to be the same as the order in which the key-value pairs were inserted into the hash. This can lead to unexpected results if the code relies on a specific iteration order. The solution demonstrates how to iterate in a deterministic order.
